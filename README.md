# Dictionary-app
I designed and built my first React Native app around a dictionary api: https://dictionaryapi.dev/. <br>
The app was built specifically for IOS using React Native Expo, using Expo Go and Xcode to debug and troubleshoot. <br>
The app takes in a word input and makes a GET request to the API using axios to retrieve the data. <br>
If the word is undefined, then the results list won't update and correct information is relayed back to the user. <br>
Scrollview is added so the user can scroll down through his past results to see what other words they struggled with in the past. <br>
Following this are some screenshots of the app in action! <br>

## How to Run Locally
Open up your terminal and direct it to the location where you want to save the app.<br>
Next, run the command ***git clone https://github.com/Zipeth1010/dictionary-app.git***. <br>
After the repository is cloned, cd into the App, and run ***npm install --all*** to install all the local dependencies. <br>
Ensure that you have installed the latest version of Xcode (If you are working on MacOS). <br>
After all of this is done, go back to your directory or IDE where the App is focused and run the command ***npm run start i***<br>
This will boot up Xcode in the IOS environment and will display the app on your default IOS device selected.<br>
