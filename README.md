# dictionary-app
I designed and built my first React Native app around a dictionary api: https://dictionaryapi.dev/. <br>
The app takes in a word input and makes a GET request to the API using axios to retrieve the data. <br>
If the word is undefined, then the results list won't update and correct information is relayed back to the user. <br>
Scrollview is added so the user can scroll down through his past results to see what other words they struggled with in the past. <br>
